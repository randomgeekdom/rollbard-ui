    "review": "I took the family to see this movie and it was a great experience. My wife and I are pretty big fans of both horror and Robert Eggers so it's not much of a surprise that we both enjoyed it.  What shocked me is how much our 16-year-old enjoyed it.  He likes horror too but usually sticks with slashers and we were very concerned that this movie was going to be a little too artsy-fartsy for him.  I'm glad we all went.  I never saw the original so I can't compare but I can compare it to Eggers's other movies.  It mostly resembles The Witch.  It's a little slow, which is why I can't give it a full 10/10, but I think it's worth watching.  The biggest surprise for me was Lily Rose Depp.  I expected Willem Dafoe, Nicholas Hoult, and the rest of the cast to give great performances and they absolutely delivered. The only one I was concerned about was Depp that I kept telling my wife, that I wish it was Anya Taylor-Joy in the role.  But she did an astounding job.",
